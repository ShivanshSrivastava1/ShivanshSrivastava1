### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ShivanshSrivastava1)

I'm Shivansh Srivastava. I finished my bachelor's degree in computer science at [Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/) in May 2023, and I'm currently back at Columbia for my master's in computer science through the MS Express program. This summer, I interned at [Google](https://about.google) as a software engineer on the Google Cloud Networking team. Prior to that, I was a software engineer intern at [Meta (formerly Facebook)](https://about.meta.com/), where I did back-end work as part of the Integrity Observation Platform team. I've also worked as a full-stack developer and ML engineer at [Skye](https://joinskye.com/), an up-and-coming coaching startup based in NYC.

During my time at Columbia, I've been a TA for the following courses:
- COMS 4156: Advanced Software Engineering with [Prof. Gail Kaiser](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kaiser/) - Fall 2024
- COMS 4705: Natural Language Processing with [Prof. Daniel Bauer](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~bauer/) - Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Summer 2023, Spring 2024
